# Thesis-ROC-Data
ROC Plots and P-values for the descriptor combinations in my Master's Thesis (SJSU)

ROC Plot Key

SA = Single amino values, Assigned switches only
SB = Single amino values, Both assigned and unassigned switches
SU = Single amino values, Unassigned switches only

TA = Triplet amino values, Assigned switches only
TB = Triplet amino values, Both assigned and unassigned switches
TU = Triplet amino values, Unassigned switches only

Each ROC plot's name also describes which descriptors were present
6 = 6-Term Entropy
2 = 20-Term Entropy
U = IsUnstruct
V = Vkabat
R = Residue Type

The original code (bugs and all!) I used will be posted as soon as I can find it.
